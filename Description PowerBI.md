# Exploring Diabetes, Medication, and Cognitive Decline

Over 37 million individuals in the US are affected by diabetes, with a significant portion unaware of their condition. Similarly, 96 million adults in the country have prediabetes, with a high percentage unaware of their status. Tragically, diabetes ranks as the eighth leading cause of death in the US, potentially being underreported. The past two decades have witnessed a drastic increase in diabetes diagnoses, paralleling the aging population and rising obesity rates.

### Introduction
My primary focus was on examining demographic data and patients' medical histories, culminating in the development of interactive dashboards to showcase my discoveries. These dashboards highlighted the relationships between diabetes and hypertension, changes in alcohol and tobacco use among diabetes patients, and the impact of diabetes and cognitive decline on lipid profiles. I also explored the effects of medication on lipid profiles and cognitive decline, utilizing additional data sources to enrich my analysis. My approach demonstrated a commitment to precise data interpretation, the capacity to design user-friendly dashboards, and adept problem-solving skills, including data modeling.

### Dataset overview
* Collected dataset from a prospective observational study assessing the impact of type 2 diabetes on cerebral vasoregulation and perfusion.
* Observed blood flow responses to various stimuli including hypocapnia and hypercapnia, Valsalva maneuver, head-up tilt, and sit-to-stand test.
* Involved 69 diabetic and control participants aged 55 to 75 years, with continuous measurements of cerebral blood flow using transcranial Doppler and MRI, alongside heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory parameters.
* Also tracked balance, walking, laboratory measures, and retinopathy at baseline, and followed 41 subjects for two years to monitor long-term effects.
  
### Data Transformation and Modeling 

#### Categorized Data Organization: 
Utilized PowerBI/PowerQuery to categorize the consolidated dataset into distinct sub-tables such as demographics, medical history, medication, labs, and cognitive tests. This categorization facilitated a more efficient and systematic analysis process.
#### Relational Database Creation:
Employed a primary key, 'id', generated by combining 'patientID' and 'visit' columns, to establish relationships between the sub-tables. This relational setup allowed for seamless data integration and cross-referencing, enabling a comprehensive view of the patient's journey and outcomes.
#### Adaptive Data Modeling:
Leveraged advanced data modeling capabilities to introduce flexibility within the dataset. This enabled us to incorporate changes, apply new calculations, and integrate additional variables without disrupting the existing data structure, thereby enhancing the project's adaptability and scalability.

#### Comprehensive Data Cleansing: 
Implemented a thorough data cleaning process, employing techniques such as deduplication, filtering, merging, and transforming data types to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the dataset. This meticulous data cleansing effort significantly improved the reliability and consistency of the data for further analysis and interpretation.

### Patient Demographics Overview
![Diabetes_Demographic](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/3d220327-217e-4b9e-9591-d5aa6b6249b7)
* 90% of patients diagnosed with diabetes are classified as obese, emphasizing the strong link between diabetes and weight management.
* 40% of patients did not attend visit 8, indicating potential challenges with follow-up care adherence.
* 37% of white male patients were identified as having diabetes, highlighting a higher prevalence within this demographic group.
* Only 1% of patients with a diabetes duration of 1-10 years attended visit 8, underscoring potential issues with long-term health management for this group.

### Unveiling the Interplay Between Diabetes and Hypertension
![Diabetes_Hypertension](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/f57df36f-afcc-42aa-9430-b0e4365cf428)
Are individuals with diabetes more likely to develop hypertension, or is it the other way around?
* Most patients were diagnosed with diabetes between the ages of 40 and 60, as indicated by the formula,
![Code1](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/8109e884-2b91-4a93-8222-e0093887ba71)
* The CDC highlights that the majority of new diabetes diagnoses in the U.S. occur among adults aged 45-64.
* Out of 77 patients, 50 have been labeled with either DM or HTN, identified through the code, 
![Code2](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/9beffe92-521c-40b2-bdfd-639dc35f84e0)
* 56% of the patients developed hypertension after being diagnosed with diabetes, deciphered by the code,
![Code3](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/edfb21ea-f0d2-423c-bde3-3c845dcd97ea)
* Research from the NIH underscores that diabetes patients experience increased peripheral artery resistance caused by vascular remodeling and increased body fluid volume associated with insulin resistance.

### Patient History for Alcohol and Tabacco Habits

The patients were classified into four distinct groups based on their historical and current alcohol usage patterns: those who consistently consumed alcohol, those who never used alcohol, those who recently started consuming alcohol, and those who previously used alcohol but have since stopped. 
The following code was employed to analyze the tobacco habits of patients, and a similar code structure was used for assessing alcohol habits as well, with the relevant columns.
![Tobacoo_habit](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/00b14755-d994-427d-81d5-7639c0331ee5)
* Most patients maintained consistent alcohol consumption habits, with minimal changes noted. 
* A notable portion of patients demonstrated adherence to medical advice and successfully ceased their tobacco usage. 
* The control group displayed a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption compared to the DM group, while the prevalence of smoking appeared relatively uniform across both groups.

### Lipid Profile Impact

#### Analysis Overview: 
The dashboard compares the lipid profiles of patients in the DM and control groups, along with those in the mild cognitive decline and cognitive decline groups.
* Despite expectations based on previous research, the observed lipid profile data did not distinctly reflect the typical patterns associated with diabetes and cognitive decline. 
* To delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to the unexpected results, an additional data source focusing on medication usage was integrated, leading to the creation of two supplementary dashboards.

### Medicine Analysis
![Medication](https://github.com/KrishnaVidja/DiabetesData_SQL_PowerBI/assets/106781881/b4cbeb36-8419-4933-a4ba-a2a39176f0db)
Could medication intake have influenced the lipid profile results in diabetes patients and those with cognitive decline?
* The data revealed four primary medication categories: diabetes, hypertension and heart-related, lipid, and cognitive. A significant portion of patients were found to be taking medication for lipid and diabetes-related conditions, with 11 patients specifically using insulin.
* A strong correlation was observed between patients' medical conditions and their medication intake. For instance, the majority of diabetes patients were taking medication for their condition, while nearly all hyperlipidemia patients were on lipid medication.
* Nearly half of the patients were simultaneously managing diabetes and lipid control through medication, and a substantial 65% were using medication for hypertension and heart-related issues.
* Notably, among patients with the highest cognitive test failure scores (cognitive scores == 4 or 5), almost all were actively taking various forms of medication, with one patient using seven different kinds of medication.

### Medication Influence on Cholesterol Levels and Cognitive Decline

Can medication usage contribute to cognitive decline? 
Is it advisable for patients to avoid taking lipid-controlling medication?
* Patients with a cognitive score of 0 generally did not use any lipid control medication. Only one patient showed slightly abnormal HDL levels, while the rest of the lipid profile was normal.
* Among patients with a cognitive score of 5, all of them were taking lipid control medication. One patient exhibited abnormal LDL levels, and four patients had slightly abnormal HDL levels.
* A majority of patients in the cognitive decline group were taking lipid medication, while only 26% of those not taking any medication were in the cognitive decline group.
* 86% of patients with cognitive decline had been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and were advised to take lipid control medication.

Throughout the project, my emphasis on data accuracy, user-friendly visualization, and proactive problem-solving highlighted my capabilities. Delving deeper into unexpected outcomes, I explored the impact of medication on lipid profiles and cognitive decline, ensuring a comprehensive analysis.

I delved deeper into the diabetes data using SQL, structuring the information in a way that made it easier to analyze. By normalizing the data and establishing relationships between different tables, I was able to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. You can explore the detailed findings and insights in the file I uploaded to the repository. Additionally, I included an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that provided a visual representation of how the data is interconnected, aiding in my analysis process.
